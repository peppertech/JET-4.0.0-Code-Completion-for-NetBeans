# Superceded by recent Typescript Definition file release with JET v6.0.0

This project will not be continued now that Type Definitions have been released for all of JET UI and Framework features.  To install JET types, run the following command from the root of your project:"

npm install @types/oracle__oraclejet

This only works with JET v6.0.0 and higher.

Work is already underway to provide a more permanent solution, but until that time, you call follow the installation instructions below to
add JET 4.0.0 custom element support to your individual project today.

***
